# Budgetish Financial tracker

Built using ReactJS as an educational exercise. I wanted a simpler way to track budget information that didn't require logging into everyone of my accounts in order to use.

## Requirements

* manual entry of transaction data
* local storage only no sending data back to server
* abilitiy to import and export transaction and budget info
* collapse data from previous months to just basic income/expense breakdowns


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
